now its working perfect, do not code i want to discusses moving on to next phases how this functionalilyt can be  Tool Integration â€“ Web Search: Integrate a web search capability (e.g. using an 
API like Google Custom Search or Bing API) that the assistant can use when an 
email asks a question or requests information not in the email. The assistant might 
decide to query the web for an answer and include the results in its reply. Document 
how the search results are retrieved and filtered for relevance. developed in out smart_email_analyzer, 
what can be the feasible approaches

do not code, i have some doubts

1. added this snippet to improve prompt of search_required
2. thinking to use duck duck go 
3. added these coloumns in the relational supabase analysis table
4. where does these search_required or not part stored in analysis table, when llama 3b reposnse comes as strucutred ouput
does it stored in insight or some where else


so if we follow option 2, 
what workflow do we have, 
when the llama 3b returns the structured ouput we extract SEARCH_REQUIRED from it 
if and stored required filed to search_required coloumn and if there is search_required is true and search_querry is avaible we will stroed the search_querry in search_result,
now this search_result will go in duck duck and this will aslo give output then how these analyze ouput and find crucks from it and save it to search_result coloumn or make a new coloumn answer
